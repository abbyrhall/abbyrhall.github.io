title: Abby does... An Intro
---

Hello, my name is Abby Hall. I'm a student, athlete, cellist, and writer. I'm also curious. I'm perpetually in a cycle of seeking out new ways to improve my life: new organization methods, new study tips, new habits. Here on this blog, I want to document my journey so I can look back at this and be proud of how far I've come (and cringe). Hopefully, you guys can get some value out of it too.

Here's a list of some of the things I want to talk about:

- Building new habits
- Organization
- Productivity
- Relaxation
- Self-improvement
- Failures

Indubitably, I will share more than what I've listed, but this is a general idea. I'm on a never-ending, relentless fight to better my life and learn about myself. Whether it be for reliability, motivation, or useful tips, I hope you accompany me for this wild ride.
